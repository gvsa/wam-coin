 check_consensus_params.py -- no consensus field is left to chance
===============================================================================

     python3 scripts/check_consensus_params.py

 WHY THIS EXISTS

 WAM does not edit upstream's chainparams, it REPLACES the file:

     scripts/patch_upstream.py
         ("src/wam/chainparams.cpp", "src/kernel/chainparams.cpp")

 That is the right way to own the consensus of a fork and it has one failure
 mode that nothing else in this repository looks for: a field upstream
 assigns and our replacement does not. The declaration still exists, the code
 that reads it still exists, and nobody is told.

 It happened. `consensus.enforce_BIP94` was declared in Consensus::Params with
 no default initialiser, read in three consensus paths --

     src/validation.cpp:4280   ContextualCheckBlockHeader
     src/node/miner.cpp:39     the block assembler
     src/pow.cpp:75            GetNextWorkRequired

 -- and assigned by no network at all. The params object is heap-allocated,
 so the reads were indeterminate. It happened to be false on this build, and
 nothing in the code said so.

 Measured consequence: mining_basic.py test_timewarp failed on WAM's regtest
 on the exact assertion the BIP94 mitigation exists to satisfy.

 Reported by Alboy on 2026-10-11 as WAM-F6, with the fix: assign it per
 network, and give the field a default so the class cannot recur.

 This check is the "so the class cannot recur" half, and it needs no copy of
 upstream to do its job. The rule is self-contained:

     every field of Consensus::Params either carries a default initialiser,
     or is assigned by every network WAM defines.

 A field that satisfies neither is read before it is written. That is the
 defect, whatever the field is for, and it is the shape that makes two nodes
 disagree about which blocks are valid.

 EXIT CODES, this project's convention

     0  every field is either defaulted or assigned by every network
     1  a field is neither -- an indeterminate read in consensus code
     2  the files could not be read, so nothing was checked
