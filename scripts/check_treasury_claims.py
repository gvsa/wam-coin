 check_treasury_claims.py -- what we SAY about the money, against the ledger
===============================================================================

     python3 scripts/check_treasury_claims.py

 WHY THIS EXISTS

 On 2 October 2026 the founder read the front page and found this sentence
 about the one venue where WAM is listed:

     No fee was asked and none was paid.

 It is true, and it reads as a lie, because 500 WAM left the treasury to that
 venue's maintainer on the same day the merge happened -- for a swap test he
 asked for, since nobody can test a swap for a coin without holding some of
 it. That spend is in docs/TREASURY_LEDGER.md with its amount, its reason and
 its transaction id, and we tell every reader to go and check that file. So
 the page invited the reader to find a 500 WAM payment we had not mentioned,
 and the question that follows a discovery like that is never about the 500.

 It was the second time. On 25 September a draft reply to three exchanges
 ended with "nothing was paid and nothing was promised" about the same venue,
 and that one was caught before it was sent -- the record is in
 posts/replies/exchange-offers-2026-09-25.txt, which says in its own words
 that writing it "would have contradicted our own record to make a cleaner
 sentence". Six days later the same sentence was on the front page.

 Two occurrences, one cause: nothing in this repository compares a claim about
 money to the ledger. check_published_claims.py reads wam-params.h, which is
 consensus -- it has no opinion about what has been spent. So the ledger had
 no detector at all, and the only thing standing between a false-looking
 sentence and the public was whoever happened to read the page.

 WHAT THIS DOES

 docs/TREASURY_LEDGER.md is the authority: every coin that has left the
 treasury is a row in it. For each published document this finds the
 paragraphs that DENY a payment, or say the treasury has not moved, and fails
 any that does not name an amount from the ledger in the same paragraph.

 Same paragraph, not the same file, and not behind a link. A denial on line 10
 and the truth on line 400 is how the front page passed every check it had.
