 check_treasury_ledger.py -- the ledger's own numbers, against the chain
===============================================================================

     python3 scripts/check_treasury_ledger.py --node 169.58.159.165

 WHY THIS EXISTS

 docs/TREASURY_LEDGER.md does not merely record the spends. It invites the
 reader to check them:

     2.5 x height  -  (every amount below + every fee below)

     At height N that is ... which is what `scantxoutset` returns. Two
     independent routes to the same number, to the last decimal place.

 That is the strongest sentence in the file and the only one that can rot
 without anybody touching it, because the chain moves on its own. On
 2026-10-11 it had: the worked example still stood at height 4,989 and
 subtracted 500 WAM, while ten further rows -- 10,010 WAM of bounty -- sat in
 the table underneath it. A reader who did what the file told him to do would
 have got a number 10,010 WAM away from the chain's, in a file about where the
 money went. Nothing in this repository noticed for nine days.

 check_treasury_claims.py already compares what we SAY about the money to the
 ledger. Nothing compared the LEDGER to the chain. This is that half.

 WHAT THIS DOES

 Four questions, and the third is the one that matters:

   1. every row is a real transaction that pays the stated amount to the
      stated address, and whose fee is the stated fee
   2. the stated balance is not older than the newest row, and is what the
      arithmetic gives at the height it names
   3. accrued(tip) - (every amount + every fee) == what the chain holds now

      If a coin ever leaves the treasury without a row, this is what finds
      it. No address index and no block scan: the identity cannot hold with
      a spend missing from the table.

   4. the worked example in the prose agrees with the table it describes

 The accrual is consensus, not a constant copied into this file:

     halvings = (height - 1) // WAM_SUBSIDY_HALVING_INTERVAL
     subsidy  = WAM_INITIAL_BLOCK_SUBSIDY >> halvings
     treasury = subsidy * WAM_DEVFEE_PERCENT // 100, for heights 1..400,000

 -- the same integer arithmetic as src/wam/consensus/subsidy.cpp, with every
 constant read out of src/wam/wam-params.h at run time. A halving that this
 script did not expect cannot make it disagree with the chain.

 EXIT CODES, this project's convention

     0  every row is on the chain and the identity holds to the atom
     1  a row is wrong, a number is stale, or coins left without a row
     2  the node could not be asked, so nothing was checked
