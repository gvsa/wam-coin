#  Two miners, one node: what happens when somebody beats you
# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/test/test_solo_race.sh [<dir with wamd, wam-cli, wam-miner>]
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS THE ONE THAT WAS MISSING
#
#  Every test this project has for solo mining runs on regtest with one miner.
#  A miner with no competitor always wins, so losing a race is unreachable by
#  every gate we own -- and losing a race is where both of the solo miner's
#  shipped faults lived:
#
#    v0.1.10  it solved blocks and never submitted them. Found by a miner, on
#             mainnet, with his own money.
#    v0.1.11  the alarm added BECAUSE of v0.1.10 could not tell a lost race
#             from a lost block, and told working miners to shut down. Found
#             by two miners, on mainnet, on 2026-10-04. One of them stopped.
#
#  Both were "tested" before release. Both were tested where they could not
#  fail. The fix for the second was written and called proved on the strength
#  of a careful read, which is the same mistake one layer up.
#
#  So this puts an opponent in the room. On regtest the difficulty is trivial,
#  which makes collisions the normal case rather than a rare one: two miners
#  against one node will solve the same height within seconds of each other
#  within a minute or two of starting.
#
#  WHAT IT ASSERTS
#
#    * a race actually happened -- otherwise the test proved nothing and says
#      so rather than passing
#    * the loser calls it a lost race, not a refusal
#    * the alarm "do not leave it running" appears NOWHERE
#    * both miners keep working afterwards and keep being paid
#
#  WHERE IT MAY RUN
#
#  Not on a machine that serves the network. The first run of this rig was on
#  seed3, by hand, and it opened three listening ports; the port monitor saw
#  them and alerted within minutes, correctly. Then the cleanup used a broad
#  pkill that came within one pattern of killing that host's real testnet
#  miner.
#
#  So: it refuses to start where wamd or a miner is already serving, binds
#  everything to 127.0.0.1 so nothing is visible from outside, picks ports
#  nobody else is using, and kills only the process ids it started itself.
# ===========================================================================

# ---- ISOLATE YOURSELF, DO NOT ASK THE OPERATOR TO REMEMBER -----------------
#
# The first version of this refused to run on a machine that serves the
# network, and left the isolation to whoever typed the command. That is a rule
# a person has to remember, and the person who wrote the rule broke it within
# the hour: the first run was by hand on seed3, opened three listening ports,
# and the port monitor alerted on them. Correctly.
#
# A rule nobody can forget is better than a rule nobody should. This re-enters
# itself inside its own PID and network namespaces, so the node and the miners
# it starts cannot see the host's processes, cannot be seen by them, and bind
# to a loopback that exists only in here. Nothing is visible from outside the
# machine, so nothing to alert on.
#
# unshare is in util-linux and is already on these hosts. Where it is missing
# or unprivileged, the old refusal below still stands as the fallback.
