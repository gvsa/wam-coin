//
//  WHAT WAS WRONG
//
//  _submitBlock held the only copy of a solved block in a local variable and
//  retried for five seconds. Five was chosen because that is how long the node
//  restart on 5 September 2026 took -- a measurement, which is better than a
//  guess, and still a number that a thirty-second wallet load or a reboot
//  walks straight past. The block was then gone: 47.5 WAM, the largest single
//  loss this pool can suffer, with a log line to remember it by.
//
//  Reported by dang150296 (Urriki1502) on 2026-10-04 as solved-block retry
//  being memory-only.
//
//  WHAT THE SPOOL PROMISES
//
//    * the bytes are written down BEFORE the node is asked
//    * a node that never answered leaves the block spooled
//    * a node that READ it and refused settles it -- no retry forever, and
//      the bytes are kept with the reason rather than deleted
//    * "duplicate" means it was already accepted, so that settles it too
//    * the drain offers everything again, at start-up above all, because that
//      is the case where this process died holding a block
// ===========================================================================
