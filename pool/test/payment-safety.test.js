// The two ways a payment run loses the pool operator's money.
//
// Both were found by reading the payment path rather than by anything going
// wrong, which is the only way either would ever have been found: each needs a
// coincidence of timing that is rare per run and certain over years.
//
//   1. Two runs overlapping. processPayments is on a setInterval. A run that
//      takes longer than the interval -- a slow daemon, two hundred outputs, a
//      wallet rescan -- is still between reading balances and clearing them
//      when the next tick starts. Both read the same balances, both build the
//      same batch, both call sendmany. Everyone is paid twice out of the
//      pool's own wallet and no log line looks wrong.
//
//   2. A crash between sendmany returning and the balances being cleared. The
//      coins are gone, the balances still say they are owed, and the next run
//      pays them again. The window is milliseconds; this project lost power
//      twice in one day.
//
// The fix for the second is not to close the window -- it cannot be closed
// without a transaction across two systems -- but to leave evidence in it, and
// to refuse to pay until a human has looked. A pool that pauses is a support
// ticket. A pool that pays twice is money.
